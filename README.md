# HealthMsgU
https://csc698-teamprep.github.io/HealthMsgU/

## HealthMsgU is a web platform that enables researchers to gauge public perception and find trends regarding health topics. The web platform gathers posts using the Twitter API and analyzes them to generate visualized statistical data.

### User Stories:

#### The following required functionality needs to completed for the MVP:

* User can enter search terms in a search field
* Tweets are pulled using Twitter’s API 
* An error message is displayed if no pertinent messages are found
* A loading screen is displayed as the web platform searches and analyzes data
* Frequency of words associated with search terms can be viewed (as table?)
* A map will display the location of where the Tweets are being generated 
* User can view data as a word cloud based on frequency
* User can learn more about the project by clicking “About Us” from the navigation bar
* User can download the data for their personal use (File type?)
* User can share the word plot via email or social media

#### The following optional features might be implemented:

* User can move seamlessly between visualizations using tabs
* User can gather data from other social media outlets such as Facebook and reddit (web-scraping)
* User can customize generated word cloud, eg: change fonts, colors, isolate certain words
* There can be a history of previous word clouds plotted with dates (e.g the most recent cloud or the most frequently plotted word association) (Database configuration)
* Web platform can pull more than 7 days of Tweets
* Timeline can display whether the Tweets are positive or negative (Machine learning)
* 3rd party authentication for user login (Facebook, Google, security)

#### Tasks our group needs to do to create the MVP:

* Host website
* Have a blurb about what HealthMsgU is 
* Have a user interface to allow the user to have search input
* Word Cloud generator: it generates a word cloud depicting the most common words associated with HIV on Twitter (Positive or Negative)
* Map of Tweet locations
